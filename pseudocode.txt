action text based game

chatgpt:
WHEN game starts:
    SHOW character selection screen (Warrior, Mage, Rogue)
    [Optional: use Bootstrap modal]

WHEN player selects a character:
    HIDE character selection screen
    STORE selected character in 'player' object

THEN:
    SHOW 2 location images on screen (Lake, Forest, or Cave)
    WAIT for player to click on a location

WHEN location is selected:
    CHANGE background to match location
    SPAWN a monster based on location
        - Forest = Goblin
        - Lake = Water Serpent (if included)

START battle loop:
    WHILE player HP > 0 AND monster HP > 0:
        MONSTER attacks first
            - Deals 10 damage to player
        PLAYER chooses:
            - Basic attack (damage varies by character)
            - Block (reduce next hit by half)
            - Special attack (unique per character) (maybe)

    IF player HP <= 0:
        SHOW “Game Over” screen

    IF monster HP <= 0:
        SHOW “Victory” screen and option to continue or end game



me:
3 characters to choose from
go to 2-3 different locations
fight a monster



when game start show characters select screen (warrior, mage, rogue) (maybe make bootstrap modal for it)

hide screen after choice

store selection in player object

transtion to 2-3 images on screen of different locations to choose from (lake, forest, or cave)

change the background to match the selection

spawn the monster (different monsters in each biome)

make monster deal 10 dmg to player each turn

player deals different dmg to monster based on character, can block,
